This is a rudimentary Minecraft viewer using the Three.js WebGL framework.

You can pretty much download this, and open up index.html to see an example map I generated in my singleplayer game.

testData.js - this is the actual data recovered from a region The format is
regionData = {region: <the region code>, chunks: <an array of chunks> }

The array of chunks is formulated as follows
{chunkLoc: <the location of the chunk>, data: <the uncompressed byte array of the chunk, formatted the exact same way as the alpha-infdev NBT chunk format>}

Things to do:
_LOTS_ of refactoring
write a JS library to read region data, which is basically a NBT file format.
Better graphics optimizations
