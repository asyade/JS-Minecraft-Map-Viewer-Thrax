## JS Minecraft Map Viewer
# What is this?
This is a minecraft map viewer written entirely in HTML5, Javascript and WebGL (THREE.js).
# What does it do?
You can load region files from your minecraft save files and it'll load them and show you a 3 dimensional view of your map, as if you were flying through the map in game
# What it does not do?
It's not minecraft for the web browser.
# Other Info
* Only loads region files in the Anvil format (Minecraft 1.2).
* Some textures are not implemented.
* Some Texture IDs are not implemented.
* Some chunks may not be rendered on first load. Just move around and they should appear.
